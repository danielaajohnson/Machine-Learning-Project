# Summary of my Machine Learning Class Project
This project predicts whether an adult makes $50k or less a year or over $50k using predictive features such as age, work class, education, e.t.c. My partner and I used two models: the Bayesian Network and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The part of the project I did was the preprocessing, meaning filling missing values using the mode, converting categorial variables to numerical using one-hot encoding, and utilizing SMOTE to balance the data, as well as implementing the Bayesian Network model experimenting with various test sizes to optimize our results. For the Bayesian Network code, you may first need to install ucimlrepo which can be done by 'pip install ucimlrepo' to run it. For both, the Bayesian Network and SVM code, you must have the adult dataset in the same folder for it to run because there is no path to the adult dataset in the code.
